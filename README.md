This repository demonstrates a common but subtle bug in R related to the calculation of the mean of a numeric vector containing missing values (NA). The `bug.R` file shows the erroneous implementation, and `bugSolution.R` provides the corrected version.  The issue arises from not explicitly handling NAs with the `na.rm` argument in the `mean()` function. This can lead to unexpected results and incorrect calculations. The solution demonstrates the correct use of `na.rm = TRUE` to exclude NAs before calculating the mean, providing a robust and accurate solution.
